# PHP-Task-Manager

## About

This project was about learning  php and I choose to do that through making a login page that opens up a user's task manager system.

In the end, I also choose to refresh on Databases as well.

The Task Manager system is not fully complete at the moment as of July 2017 but has some funtionality. The Login system is working.

## Setup

### Database
I've provided the MySQL script under `scripts/tmsDB.sql` to create the database structure and populate your first user for testing.

No worries :)

Remeber to change the credientials for your own database access.

### Server

Used XAMPP with default settings (version 3.2.2), PHP version on XAMPP is 5.6.30. You should be able to clone this repository into `htdocs` and it will run, if everything is setup correctly.
